![mockup](assets/testing/am%20i%20responsive.png)

Car Talk Blog is a blog is a blog where users can register an account which allows them to like/unlike posts, comment on a post and once logged in users can upload their own post and also edit/delete their post.

The aim of this project is for users to easily sign up and connect with other users on the blog by liking and commenting on eachothers posts.

## UX 

Some of the colours I used when developing this site, I kept the colours simple so it wouldnt distract the users from the site.


- `#23BBBB` used for the authors name appearing on the image card when viewed on the home page.
- `#445261`  used for when the user clicks on the image card to view the blog details.
- `#E84610` used for when the user hovers over the title of the blog on the home page and also for the like button.
- `#23BBBB` used for the background colour for the sign up / sign in button.


## Typography

[Lato and Road Rage](https://fonts.google.com/) waa used for the site text.
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the icons seen throughout the site.
